-> (29)_Inspecting with React Dev Tools :

1. Inspection : Allows inspection of React component heirarchies.
2. State & Props : View and edit the current state and props of components.
3. Performance : Analyze component re-renders and performance.
4. Navigation : Conveniently navigate through the entire component.
5. Filtering : Filter components by name or source to locate them quickly.
6. Real-time Feedback : See live changes as we modify state or props.

-> (30)_How React Works :

1. Root Component :

(i) The App is the main or root component of a React application. Though there is "index.html" before there but its not a component. So "App.jsx" is the main component
(ii) It's the starting point of our react component tree.

2. Virtual DOM :

(i) React creates an in-memory structure called the virtual DOM.
(ii) Virtual DOM is different from the actual Browser DOM.
(iii) It's a lightweight representation where each node stands for a component and its attributes.

3. Reconciliation Process :

(i) When component data changes, React updates the virtual DOM's state to mirror these changes.
(ii) React then compares the current and previous versions of the virtual DOM.
(iii) It identifies the specific nodes that need updating.
(iv) Then only those nodes are updated in the real browser DOM (since the browser can't do it), making it efficient.
