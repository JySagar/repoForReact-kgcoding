-> Difference b/w JS and React :

JS : JS is imperative i.e. we need to define steps to reach our desired state. 

React : React is declarative i.e. we need to define the target UI state and then react figures out how to reach that state.

-> Components : Helps us to write reusable, modular and better organized code. eg : We divide a web page into header component, side bar comp, etc and then we combine all these to make the pages.

React application is a tree of components with App Component as the root bringing everything together.

-> IDE : Integreted Development Environment. It contains basic tools required for software development. It is a central hub for coding, finding problems and testing. Designed to improve developer efficiency.

Need : Streamlines development, Increases productivity, Simplifies complex task, Offers a unified workspace, IDE features : Code autocomplete, Systax Higlighting, Version control, Error checking.
